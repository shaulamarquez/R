# Divvy Bike Share Analysis with R Studio

Welcome to my Divvy Bike Share Analysis project! This repository contains R scripts and notebooks that explore and analyze the Divvy Bike Share data. Through this project, I aim to provide insights into bike usage patterns, user demographics, and other interesting trends related to the Divvy bike-sharing system.

## Overview

Divvy is a popular bike-sharing system in several cities, offering a sustainable and convenient mode of transportation. This analysis dives into the Divvy bike share data to uncover valuable information and trends.

## Features

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Description:** Cleaning and preprocessing of raw Divvy Bike Share data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring data integrity.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Description:** Exploring key statistics, visualizations, and trends in the Divvy data. EDA helps in understanding the distribution of rides, popular routes, and usage patterns.

### 3. User Demographics and Behavior

- **Description:** Analyzing user demographics, subscription types, and behavior patterns. This project segment focuses on understanding the diversity of Divvy bike users.

### 4. Predictive Modeling

- **Description:** Building predictive models to forecast bike demand, user preferences, or other relevant factors. This step requires more advanced analytics and machine learning techniques.
